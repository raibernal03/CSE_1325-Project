# CSE 1325 Final Project

This project is a set of mini games which earn you points to level up a virtual pet.

the three mini games are:

1. Hangman.Hangman (word guessing game)
1. Tick Tack Toe
1. Rock, Paper, Scissors (random number game)

Each of these games will have at least two difficulties, and you will be able to earn points from winning the games

## Game Descriptions

### Hangman.Hangman (HM)

There will be a word bank where we will pull from and the user will input different letters to see which would match the word. When the user thinks they know the word they will have a chance to enter the entire word.

#### difficulty level:

Will be determined by the length of the word

### Tick Tack Toe (TTT)

we will have a 3 x 3 grid where users can place an X or an O, whoever gets three symbols in a row first wins.
there will be a coin flip to see who goes first (user or computer)

#### Difficulty levels:

there will be two difficulties

1. visible 3x3 grid
2. grid made of numbers - where the grid is just the numbers 1-9 and the user/ computer types in the number they want to claim

### Rock Paper Scissors (RPS)

Classic RPS game, best out of three wins

---

### Virtual Pet

after winning each of the games you will earn points to level up your virtual pet (VP)
however if you lose a game you will subtract those points from your VP

If you get to negative points you will be locked into the game you lost at.

The pet will have a total of 3 levels, and every 25 they'll be able to upgrade
