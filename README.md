## Game Descriptions

### Hangman.Hangman (HM)

A word guessing game, where we pull a word from a file and have the user guess either the whole letter or the whole word. They have 7 lives, and can earn from 3-5 points

#### difficulty level:

Will be determined by the length of the word. The three different difficulties are: 4-5 letter, 6-7 letters, 8-9 letters. 

### Tick Tack Toe (TTT)

we will have a 3 x 3 grid where users can place an X or an O, whoever gets three symbols in a row first wins.
there will be a coin flip to see who goes first (user or computer)

#### Difficulty levels:

there will be two difficulties

1. visible 3x3 grid
2. grid made of numbers - where the grid is just the numbers 1-9 and the user/ computer types in the number they want to claim

### Rock Paper Scissors (RPS)

Classic Rock Paper Scissors.    each game you win gets you a single point. 

---

### Virtual Pet

after winning each of the games you will earn points to level up your virtual pet (VP)
however if you lose a game you will subtract those points from your VP

If you get to negative points you will be locked into the game you lost at.

The pet will have a total of 3 levels, and every 25 they'll be able to upgrade
